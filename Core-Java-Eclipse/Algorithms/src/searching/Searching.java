/* Binary Search : To do this, the array must be sorted. 
 * 		Find the middle index of the array, and check whether the 'searching value' is above or below from
 * the middle. If below, proceed with the left side and vice versa. And, again continue it with the same procedure 
 * until the end. 
 * Time Complexity:  O(log N)
 * 
 * Linear Search : check every number in the array with the target number. Also, used as max number, min number 
 * in the array, no of 4 digit integers, no of 'r' characters in a string  etc.,
 * Time Complexity: O(1) for best case, O(N) for worst case
