	// Data Structure --> A named location that can be used to store and organize data.
	// Array --> A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
	// Algorithm --> A collection of steps to solve a problem. Eg:Linear Search-examine the elements
	// of an array one by one to find a value
	
	// Why DSA? To write code that is both time and memory efficient
